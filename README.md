All work will be in Main.java (unless you want to use a helper method, but that is not required).

One Saturday morning, two friends, Bugs and Daffy, decide to meet and plant flowers to beautify Santong island. 

Daffy starts in the northwest corner facing east with 90 flowers in his pouch. 

Bugs starts in the northeast corner facing west with 90 flowers in his pouch. 

Bugs and Daffy begin hopping toward one another at the same time. 

As they hop, each plants exactly one flower at every location it enters, including its starting location. 

They meet, facing each other, roughly in the middle of row 0. 

After a handshake and a little small talk, Bugs and Daffy both turn toward the south 
and continue planting flowers all the way to the southern edge of the island. 

When both reach the South Sea, they say goodbye and part. 

Daffy turns west and plants flowers all the way to the Western Ocean. 

Bugs turns east and plants flowers all the way to the Eastern Ocean. 

This is where our story ends. 

Your task is to write a Jeroo program in Main.java that will illustrate this story.
